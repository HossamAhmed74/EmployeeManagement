# Employee Management Mini System

A small Employee Management system built with **ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 8)**, **Entity Framework Core (Code-First)** and **SQL Server**. It supports full CRUD on employees, searching, and links each employee to a department.

> Built as the technical assessment for the .NET Developer position at AI Makers.

## Tech stack

- ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 8) + C#
- Entity Framework Core 8 (Code-First migrations)
- SQL Server (LocalDB by default)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
- Git / GitHub

## Architecture

The project follows a layered structure (Repository + Service pattern):

```
Controllers  ->  Services  ->  Repositories  ->  EF Core DbContext  ->  SQL Server
```

- **Models/** – `Employee`, `Department`
- **Data/** – `AppDbContext` (configuration + seed data)
- **Repositories/** – data-access layer (`IEmployeeRepository`, `IDepartmentRepository`, …)
- **Services/** – business logic (`IEmployeeService`, `IDepartmentService`, …)
- **Controllers/** – `EmployeesController`
- **Views/Employees/** – Index, Create, Edit, Details, Delete (+ shared `_Form` partial)

## How to run

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- SQL Server — **LocalDB** (ships with Visual Studio) works out of the box

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HossamAhmed74/EmployeeManagement.git
   cd EmployeeManagement
   ```

2. (Optional) Update the connection string in `EmployeeManagement/appsettings.json` if you are not using LocalDB:
   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
     "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=EmployeeManagementDb;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True"
   }
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   cd EmployeeManagement
   dotnet run
   ```
   The database and seed data are created **automatically** on startup (`db.Database.Migrate()`).

4. Open the app in your browser:
   - http://localhost:5003

### Database setup options

- **Automatic** – just run the app; migrations are applied on startup.
- **EF CLI** – `dotnet ef database update`
- **SQL script** – run `Database/EmployeeManagementDb.sql` against your SQL Server instance.

## Notes

- Email is enforced unique at the database level and validated in the controller.
- Departments cannot be deleted while employees are linked to them (`DeleteBehavior.Restrict`).
- The app opens directly on the Employees list.
